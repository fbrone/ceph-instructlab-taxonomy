        Cephadm allows upgrading Ceph safely from one point release to the next.
        The automated process adheres to best practices, starting with managers and
        monitors before other daemons. Each daemon is restarted only if the cluster
        remains available. During upgrades, the cluster health may show
        HEALTH_WARNING. Offline hosts pause the upgrade.
        To upgrade, verify all hosts are online and the cluster is healthy using
        `ceph -s`. Then, initiate the upgrade with `ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version <version>`.
        For example, to upgrade to v16.2.6, use:
        ```
        ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version 16.2.6
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the starting point for a Ceph upgrade process?
        answer: |
          Ceph upgrades begin with managers and monitors, then proceed to other daemons.
      - question: |
          What happens if a host is offline during an upgrade?
        answer: |
          If a host is offline, the upgrade process is paused.
      - question: |
          How can you verify the clusterâ€™s readiness for an upgrade?
        answer: |
          Run the command `ceph -s` to ensure all hosts are online and the cluster is healthy.
  - context: |
        Cephadm includes monitoring tools for upgrades. To check if an upgrade is in progress
        and the target version, use:
        ```
        ceph orch upgrade status
        ```
        During upgrades, progress bars are visible in the `ceph -s` output. Logs can be viewed
        with `ceph -W cephadm`. If issues arise, the upgrade can be stopped using:
        ```
        ceph orch upgrade stop
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can you check if a Ceph upgrade is in progress?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph orch upgrade status` to check upgrade progress.
      - question: |
          How can you view logs during a Ceph upgrade?
        answer: |
          Run the command `ceph -W cephadm` to view logs.
      - question: |
          How do you stop an ongoing Ceph upgrade?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph orch upgrade stop` to stop the upgrade.
  - context: |
        Cephadm supports staggered upgrades, allowing phased upgrades by limiting daemon types,
        services, or hosts. For instance:
        ```
        ceph orch upgrade start --image <image-name> --daemon-types mgr,mon --hosts host1,host2
        ```
        Upgrades follow a strict order: mgr -> mon -> crash -> osd -> mds -> rgw -> rbd-mirror ->
        cephfs-mirror -> iscsi -> nfs. Parameters are validated before upgrades begin.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is a staggered upgrade in Cephadm?
        answer: |
          A staggered upgrade involves upgrading components in phases, such as by daemon types, services, or hosts.
      - question: |
          What is the default upgrade order in Cephadm?
        answer: |
          The order is mgr -> mon -> crash -> osd -> mds -> rgw -> rbd-mirror -> cephfs-mirror -> iscsi -> nfs.
      - question: |
          How do you limit an upgrade to specific daemon types?
        answer: |
          Use the `--daemon-types` parameter, e.g., `--daemon-types mgr,mon`.
  - context: |
        Upgrading to Ceph v16.2.6 or later requires using images from the `quay.io` registry.
        For Docker-based clusters:
        ```
        ceph orch upgrade start --image quay.io/ceph/ceph:v16.2.6
        ```
        If container pulling fails (`UPGRADE_FAILED_PULL`), check the registry availability or
        specify a valid image. Use:
        ```
        ceph orch upgrade stop
        ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version <version>
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Where are Ceph images hosted from version v16.2.6 onward?
        answer: |
          Images are hosted on the `quay.io` registry.
      - question: |
          What does the `UPGRADE_FAILED_PULL` alert indicate?
        answer: |
          It means Ceph was unable to pull the container image for the target version.
      - question: |
          How do you resolve an image pull failure during an upgrade?
        answer: |
          Stop the upgrade with `ceph orch upgrade stop` and restart with a valid image.
  - context: |
        Cephadm supports custom container images for upgrades. Specify the container image using:
        ```
        ceph orch upgrade start --image <custom-image>
        ```
        Staggered upgrades require manual steps when upgrading from versions without support.
        First, manually upgrade manager daemons:
        ```
        ceph orch daemon redeploy mgr.example --image <new-image>
        ```
        Afterward, use the usual upgrade command with limiting parameters.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you use custom container images for Ceph upgrades?
        answer: |
          Specify the image using the `--image` parameter during the upgrade command.
      - question: |
          What is required for staggered upgrades from unsupported versions?
        answer: |
          Manually upgrade manager daemons before applying limiting parameters.
      - question: |
          How do you redeploy a manager daemon with a custom image?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph orch daemon redeploy mgr.example --image <new-image>`.
