        **SNMP Gateway Service** in Ceph integrates with Prometheus Alertmanager to forward alerts as SNMP notifications.
        The gateway daemon, from the `snmp_notifier` project, supports SNMP V2c and V3, with V1 not supported.
        SNMP V3 provides options for authentication only (authNoPriv) or authentication with encryption (authPriv).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the SNMP Gateway Service in Ceph?
        answer: |
          It forwards Prometheus Alertmanager alerts as SNMP notifications to a designated SNMP management platform.
      - question: |
          Which SNMP versions are supported by the SNMP Gateway Service?
        answer: |
          It supports SNMP V2c and V3, but not V1.
      - question: |
          What are the SNMP V3 options available in the gateway service?
        answer: |
          It offers `authNoPriv` (authentication only) and `authPriv` (authentication with encryption).
  - context: |
        SNMP Gateway Service in Ceph deploys one instance by default.
        You can increase the number of gateway daemons using placement information, but deploying multiple daemons will result in duplicate notifications for the same event.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How many SNMP Gateway daemons are deployed by default?
        answer: |
          One instance is deployed by default.
      - question: |
          What happens if multiple SNMP Gateway daemons are deployed?
        answer: |
          The SNMP management platform receives duplicate notifications for the same event.
      - question: |
          How can the number of gateway daemons be increased?
        answer: |
          By specifying placement information during deployment.
  - context: |
        To deploy an SNMP Gateway Service for SNMP V2c, use the following command:
        ```
        ceph orch apply snmp-gateway --port 9464 --snmp_version=V2c --destination=192.168.122.73:162 -i ./snmp_creds.yaml
        ```
        The credentials file should include:
        ```yaml
        snmp_community: public
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you deploy an SNMP Gateway Service for SNMP V2c?
        answer: |
          By using the command `ceph orch apply snmp-gateway` with the necessary parameters and a credentials file.
      - question: |
          What must the credentials file contain for SNMP V2c?
        answer: |
          The `snmp_community` value, such as:
          ```yaml
          snmp_community: public
          ```
      - question: |
          What is the default port for the SNMP Gateway Service?
        answer: |
          The default port is 9464.
  - context: |
        For SNMP V3 with authentication only (authNoPriv), use the following command:
        ```
        ceph orch apply snmp-gateway --snmp-version=V3 --engine-id=800C53F000000 --destination=192.168.122.1:162 -i ./snmpv3_creds.yml
        ```
        The credentials file should include:
        ```yaml
        snmp_v3_auth_username: myuser
        snmp_v3_auth_password: mypassword
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you deploy an SNMP Gateway Service for SNMP V3 with authentication only?
        answer: |
          By using the command `ceph orch apply snmp-gateway` with `--snmp-version=V3` and a credentials file.
      - question: |
          What must the credentials file contain for SNMP V3 with authentication only?
        answer: |
          The username and password, such as:
          ```yaml
          snmp_v3_auth_username: myuser
          snmp_v3_auth_password: mypassword
          ```
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the engine ID in SNMP V3 deployment?
        answer: |
          The engine ID is a unique identifier for the device, required for SNMP V3.
  - context: |
        SNMP V3 with authentication and encryption (authPriv) requires additional credentials.
        Example command:
        ```
        ceph orch apply snmp-gateway --snmp-version=V3 --engine-id=800C53F000000 --destination=192.168.122.1:162 --privacy-protocol=AES -i ./snmpv3_creds.yml
        ```
        Credentials file should include:
        ```yaml
        snmp_v3_auth_username: myuser
        snmp_v3_auth_password: mypassword
        snmp_v3_priv_password: mysecret
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you deploy an SNMP Gateway Service for SNMP V3 with encryption?
        answer: |
          By using the command `ceph orch apply snmp-gateway` with `--privacy-protocol` and a credentials file.
      - question: |
          What must the credentials file include for SNMP V3 with encryption?
        answer: |
          The username, authentication password, and privacy password, such as:
          ```yaml
          snmp_v3_auth_username: myuser
          snmp_v3_auth_password: mypassword
          snmp_v3_priv_password: mysecret
          ```
      - question: |
          What is the role of the privacy protocol in SNMP V3 deployment?
        answer: |
          It enables encryption for secure communication with the SNMP management platform.
