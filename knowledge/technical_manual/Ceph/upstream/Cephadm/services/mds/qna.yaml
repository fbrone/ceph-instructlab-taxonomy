        The MDS (Metadata Server) service in Ceph is essential for using the CephFS file system.
        One or more MDS daemons are required, and they are automatically created when using the ceph fs volume interface to create a new file system.
        For example, you can use the command:
        ```
        ceph fs volume create <fs_name> --placement="<placement spec>"
        ```
        Here, `<fs_name>` is the name of the CephFS, and `<placement spec>` determines the placement of MDS daemons.

      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the MDS service in Ceph?
        answer: |
          The MDS service is essential for using the CephFS file system.
      - question: |
          How are MDS daemons created when using the ceph fs volume interface?
        answer: |
          They are created automatically when a new file system is created using the ceph fs volume interface.
      - question: |
          Provide an example command to create a new file system using MDS daemons.
        answer: |
          Example: `ceph fs volume create <fs_name> --placement="<placement spec>"`.
  - context: |
        MDS daemons can be manually deployed by creating a specification file.
        For example:
        ```yaml
        service_type: mds
        service_id: fs_name
        placement:
          count: 3
          label: mds
        ```
        This specification can be applied using the command:
        ```
        ceph orch apply -i mds.yaml
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Can MDS daemons be manually deployed in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Yes, MDS daemons can be manually deployed using a specification file.
      - question: |
          What is an example of an MDS daemon specification file?
        answer: |
          Example:
          ```yaml
          service_type: mds
          service_id: fs_name
          placement:
            count: 3
            label: mds
          ```
      - question: |
          How is an MDS specification applied to deploy daemons?
        answer: |
          Using the command: `ceph orch apply -i mds.yaml`.
  - context: |
        You can update the placement of MDS daemons after creating a file system.
        For example, to place the MDS daemons for the `foo` file system on hosts labeled with `mds`, use the command:
        ```
        ceph orch apply mds foo 'mds-[012]'
        ```
        This flexibility allows administrators to manage and reassign resources effectively.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Can the placement of MDS daemons be updated after creation?
        answer: |
          Yes, the placement of MDS daemons can be updated after creating the file system.
      - question: |
          Provide an example command to update the placement of MDS daemons.
        answer: |
          Example: `ceph orch apply mds foo 'mds-[012]'`.
      - question: |
          Why would you update the placement of MDS daemons?
        answer: |
          To manage and reassign resources effectively.
  - context: |
        The placement of MDS daemons can be specified during the creation of a new file system.
        For example:
        ```
        ceph fs volume create foo --placement="label:mds"
        ```
        This command places MDS daemons for the new `foo` file system on hosts labeled with `mds`.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can you specify the placement of MDS daemons during file system creation?
        answer: |
          By using the `--placement` flag in the `ceph fs volume create` command.
      - question: |
          Provide an example of specifying MDS daemon placement during creation.
        answer: |
          Example: `ceph fs volume create foo --placement="label:mds"`.
      - question: |
          What does the placement flag do in the ceph fs volume create command?
        answer: |
          It determines which hosts the MDS daemons will be placed on.
  - context: |
        The Ceph documentation provides further reading on the MDS service and its deployment methods.
        Key references include topics on the Ceph File System and stateless services such as MDS, RGW, NFS, and more.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Where can you find more information about the MDS service in Ceph?
        answer: |
          In the Ceph documentation under the sections for the Ceph File System and stateless services.
      - question: |
          What other services are mentioned alongside MDS in the Ceph documentation?
        answer: |
          RGW, NFS, RBD mirror, and iSCSI are other stateless services mentioned.
      - question: |
          Why is it important to refer to the Ceph documentation for MDS?
        answer: |
          To gain detailed guidance on deployment and management of MDS and related services.
