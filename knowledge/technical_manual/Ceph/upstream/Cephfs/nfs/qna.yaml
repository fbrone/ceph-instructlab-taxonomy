      Overview of NFS-Ganesha and CephFS Integration
      ---------------------------------------------

      NFS-Ganesha is a protocol server that allows CephFS namespaces to be exported over NFS. Key points include:

      - NFS-Ganesha supports the integration of CephFS using the FSAL_CEPH plugin.
      - The preferred way to manage NFS-Ganesha clusters and CephFS exports is using `ceph nfs` commands with \
      cephadm or rook.
      - Recommended NFS-Ganesha version is 3.5+ with Ceph Pacific (16.2.x) or later.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is NFS-Ganesha used for in relation to CephFS?
        answer: |
          NFS-Ganesha allows CephFS namespaces to be exported over NFS using the FSAL_CEPH plugin.
      - question: |
          What is the recommended version of NFS-Ganesha for use with Ceph Pacific?
        answer: |
          The recommended version is NFS-Ganesha 3.5 or later with Ceph Pacific (16.2.x) or later.
      - question: |
          Which plugin in NFS-Ganesha is used to integrate with CephFS?

      Configuring NFS-Ganesha for CephFS
      ----------------------------------

      To set up NFS-Ganesha for CephFS:

      - Use the `ganesha.conf` configuration file with FSAL_CEPH.
      - Minimize Ganesha caching to optimize performance with libcephfs clients.
      - Store client recovery data in RADOS OMAP key-value interface.
      - Mandate NFSv4.1+ protocol for access.
      - Ensure CephFS metadata and data pools are correctly set using:
        ```
        ceph osd pool application set <cephfs_metadata_pool> cephfs <cephfs_data_pool> cephfs
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Which configuration file is used to set up NFS-Ganesha for CephFS?
        answer: |
          The `ganesha.conf` configuration file is used to set up NFS-Ganesha for CephFS.
      - question: |
          Why is it recommended to minimize Ganesha caching when using FSAL_CEPH?
        answer: |
          Minimizing Ganesha caching is recommended because libcephfs clients also cache aggressively.
      - question: |
          How can you set the CephFS metadata and data pools for NFS-Ganesha?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `ceph osd pool application set <cephfs_metadata_pool> cephfs <cephfs_data_pool> cephfs`.

      Requirements for NFS-Ganesha with CephFS
      ----------------------------------------

      Setting up NFS-Ganesha for CephFS requires:

      - A Ceph file system configured in the cluster.
      - NFS-Ganesha-related packages such as `libcephfs2`, `nfs-ganesha`, and `nfs-ganesha-ceph` installed on the \
      NFS server host.
      - The NFS-Ganesha server host must be connected to the Ceph public network.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What packages are required to set up NFS-Ganesha for CephFS?
        answer: |
          The required packages are `libcephfs2`, `nfs-ganesha`, and `nfs-ganesha-ceph`.
      - question: |
          What network should the NFS-Ganesha server host be connected to?
        answer: |
          The NFS-Ganesha server host must be connected to the Ceph public network.
      - question: |
          What is the primary requirement for setting up NFS-Ganesha for CephFS?
        answer: |
          A Ceph file system must be configured in the cluster.

      Using NFSv4 Clients with NFS-Ganesha
      ------------------------------------

      NFS-Ganesha exports are best accessed using NFSv4.1+ protocols to leverage session benefits. Mount commands:

      ```
      mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4.1,proto=tcp <ganesha-host-name>:<ganesha-pseudo-path> <mount-point>
      ```

      - Replace `<ganesha-host-name>` with the NFS-Ganesha server's hostname.
      - Replace `<ganesha-pseudo-path>` with the export path.
      - Replace `<mount-point>` with the local mount directory path.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Which NFS protocol version is recommended for mounting NFS-Ganesha exports?
        answer: |
          The NFSv4.1+ protocol is recommended for mounting NFS-Ganesha exports.
      - question: |
          What does `<ganesha-host-name>` represent in the mount command?
        answer: |
          `<ganesha-host-name>` represents the hostname of the NFS-Ganesha server.
      - question: |
          Why is NFSv4.1+ preferred for mounting NFS-Ganesha exports?
        answer: |
          NFSv4.1+ is preferred for its session benefits.

      Configuring libcephfs Clients for NFS-Ganesha
      --------------------------------------------

      Configure `ceph.conf` for libcephfs clients:

      - Use the `[client]` section with the `mon_host` option to connect to Ceph monitors.
      - Generate minimal configuration using:
        ```
        ceph config generate-minimal-conf
        ```
      Example configuration:
      ```
      [client]
          mon host = [v2:192.168.1.7:3300,v1:192.168.1.7:6789], [v2:192.168.1.8:3300,v1:192.168.1.8:6789], \
      [v2:192.168.1.9:3300,v1:192.168.1.9:6789]
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you specify monitor hosts for libcephfs clients in `ceph.conf`?
        answer: |
          Use the `[client]` section with the `mon_host` option to specify monitor hosts.
      - question: |
          Which command generates a minimal configuration file for libcephfs clients?
        answer: |
          The command `ceph config generate-minimal-conf` generates a minimal configuration file for libcephfs clients.
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the `[client]` section in `ceph.conf` for libcephfs clients?
        answer: |
          The `[client]` section is used to configure options like `mon_host` to connect to Ceph monitors.
