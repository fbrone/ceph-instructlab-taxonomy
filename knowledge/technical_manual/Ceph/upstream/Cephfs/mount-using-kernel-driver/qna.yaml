      Overview of CephFS Kernel Driver
      --------------------------------

      The CephFS kernel driver is part of the Linux kernel, allowing CephFS to be mounted as a regular file
      system with native kernel performance. It supports backward compatibility with the old mount syntax
      but recommends the new device string syntax for better functionality. The kernel driver requires
      monitor addresses and user credentials to mount CephFS securely.

      - question: |
          What is the CephFS kernel driver?
        answer: |
          The CephFS kernel driver is part of the Linux kernel, allowing CephFS to be mounted as a regular
          file system with native kernel performance.
      - question: |
          Why is the new device string syntax recommended for mounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          The new syntax improves functionality and compatibility with modern systems, although the old
          syntax is still supported for backward compatibility.
      - question: |
          What details are required to mount CephFS using the kernel driver?
        answer: |
          Monitor addresses and user credentials are required to mount CephFS securely.

      Prerequisites for Mounting CephFS
      ---------------------------------

      Before mounting CephFS using the kernel driver, ensure the following:
      - The `mount.ceph` helper is installed to simplify mounting.
      - Use a kernel version that supports CephFS features; a 4.x kernel or later is recommended for Ceph
        10.x (Jewel) and above.
      - For distributions with CephFS support, verify backported fixes with your vendor.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the role of the `mount.ceph` helper in mounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          The `mount.ceph` helper simplifies the mounting process by automatically providing monitor
          addresses and user credentials.
      - question: |
          Which kernel version is recommended for Ceph 10.x (Jewel) and later?
        answer: |
          A 4.x kernel or later is recommended for Ceph 10.x (Jewel) and above.
      - question: |
          Why should you check with your vendor for CephFS support in distributions?
        answer: |
          Vendors are responsible for backporting CephFS fixes to their stable kernels.

      Mounting CephFS Using Kernel Driver
      -----------------------------------

      Use the `mount` command with the `-t ceph` option to mount CephFS. The command requires:
      - A device string specifying the CephX user, cluster FSID, and file system name.
      - Options for monitor addresses (`mon_addr`) and secret keys (`secret` or `secretfile`).
      Example:
      ```
      mount -t ceph cephuser@<fsid>.cephfs=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o mon_addr=192.168.0.1:6789,secretfile=/path/to/secret
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you specify the CephX user and file system name when mounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          Include the CephX user and file system name in the device string, e.g., `cephuser@<fsid>.cephfs=/`.
      - question: |
          What option can you use to pass a secret key without exposing it in the shell command history?
        answer: |
          Use the `secretfile` option to specify the path to a file containing the secret key.
      - question: |
          How can you mount a subtree of the CephFS root?
        answer: |
          Append the desired path to the device string, e.g., `cephuser@<fsid>.cephfs=/subvolume/dir`.

      Backward Compatibility and Mount Helper
      ---------------------------------------

      The old CephFS mount syntax is still supported for backward compatibility. For example:
      ```
      mount -t ceph :/ /mnt/mycephfs -o name=admin
      ```
      The `mount.ceph` helper can automatically retrieve monitor addresses and user credentials, simplifying
      the process. For non-default file systems, use the `fs=` option:
      ```
      mount -t ceph :/ /mnt/mycephfs -o name=admin,fs=cephfs2
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the `mount.ceph` helper?
        answer: |
          The `mount.ceph` helper simplifies mounting by automatically retrieving monitor addresses and
          user credentials.
      - question: |
          How do you mount a non-default file system using the old syntax?
        answer: |
          Use the `fs=` option, e.g., `mount -t ceph :/ /mnt/mycephfs -o name=admin,fs=cephfs2`.
      - question: |
          Is the old CephFS mount syntax still supported?
        answer: |
          Yes, the old syntax is supported for backward compatibility.

      Persistent Mounts and Unmounting
      --------------------------------

      To mount CephFS persistently, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:
      ```
      cephuser@.cephfs=/ /mnt/ceph ceph mon_addr=192.168.0.1:6789,secretfile=/path/to/secretfile,noatime,_netdev 0 0
      ```
      To unmount CephFS, use the `umount` command:
      ```
      umount /mnt/cephfs
      ```
      Ensure that no processes are using the file system before unmounting.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you persistently mount CephFS using `/etc/fstab`?
        answer: |
          Add an entry specifying the CephX user, file system, and options like `mon_addr` and `secretfile`.
      - question: |
          How do you unmount CephFS?
        answer: |
          Use the `umount` command, e.g., `umount /mnt/cephfs`.
      - question: |
          What should you ensure before unmounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          Ensure that no processes are using the file system directories before unmounting.
