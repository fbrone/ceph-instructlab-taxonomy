  - context: |
        To configure an ESXi host to use the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway, ensure the prerequisites are met. These include an
        ESXi host running VMware vSphere Hypervisor (version 7.0U3 or later), a deployed Ceph NVMe-oF gateway, a Ceph
        cluster configured for NVMe-oF, and a defined subsystem within the gateway. Proper setup enables the ESXi host
        to achieve high-performance storage with reduced latency and increased bandwidth.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What version of VMware ESXi is required for configuring NVMe-oF?
        answer: |
          VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 7.0U3 or later is required.
      - question: What is needed within the Ceph cluster for NVMe-oF functionality?
        answer: |
          The Ceph cluster must be configured for NVMe-oF.
      - question: What does the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway provide?
        answer: |
          The Ceph NVMe-oF gateway enables ESXi hosts to use high-performance NVMe-oF storage.
      - question: What is the purpose of defining a subsystem in the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway?
        answer: |
          The subsystem acts as a logical representation for NVMe-oF services, enabling communication with initiators.
  - context: |
        Configuring VMware ESXi for NVMe/TCP involves enabling NVMe/TCP on a NIC and tagging a VMKernel NIC to permit
        NVMe/TCP traffic. This setup is critical to ensure the ESXi host can communicate with NVMe-oF gateways.
        Enabling NVMe/TCP enhances storage performance by reducing latency and increasing bandwidth.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How do you enable NVMe/TCP on a NIC in VMware ESXi?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `esxcli nvme fabric enable --protocol TCP --device vmnicN`, replacing `N` with the NIC number.
      - question: How can you tag a VMKernel NIC for NVMe/TCP traffic?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `esxcli network ip interface tag add --interface-name vmkN --tagname NVMeTCP`, replacing `N`
          with the VMkernel ID.
      - question: Why is enabling NVMe/TCP important for VMware ESXi hosts?
        answer: |
          Enabling NVMe/TCP reduces latency and improves bandwidth, enabling high-performance storage access.
  - context: |
        Listing and discovering NVMe-oF adapters and subsystems are the initial steps in configuring an ESXi host for
        NVMe-oF. These steps provide details about available adapters and subsystems, which are essential for connecting
        the host to the storage infrastructure.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Which command lists the available NVMe-oF adapters on the ESXi host?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `esxcli nvme adapter list`.
      - question: How do you discover NVMe-oF subsystems from an NVMe/TCP adapter?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `esxcli nvme fabric discover -a NVME_TCP_ADAPTER -i GATEWAY_IP -p 4420`.
      - question: What information is needed to discover an NVMe-oF subsystem?
        answer: |
          You need the NVMe/TCP adapter name, the gateway IP address, and the port number (default is 4420).
  - context: |
        Connecting to an NVMe-oF gateway subsystem allows VMware ESXi hosts to access storage resources. The connection
        is established using the subsystem's NQN and gateway details. Properly connecting ensures the storage can be
        utilized by the host.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What command connects to the NVMe-oF gateway subsystem?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `esxcli nvme connect -a NVME_TCP_ADAPTER -i GATEWAY_IP -p 4420 -s SUBSYSTEM_NQN`.
      - question: What is the role of the NQN in connecting to an NVMe-oF gateway?
        answer: |
          The NQN uniquely identifies the subsystem, enabling the host to establish a connection to the correct resource.
      - question: How can you verify if the connection to the NVMe-oF gateway is established?
        answer: |
          Run the command: `esxcli nvme controller list` and check if the "Connected" column shows "true".
  - context: |
        After connecting to an NVMe-oF gateway, listing the controllers and namespaces verifies the setup. It also
        provides details about available storage resources. The vSphere client can then confirm the proper configuration
        and readiness of NVMe/TCP disks.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How do you list NVMe/TCP controllers in VMware ESXi?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `esxcli nvme controller list`.
      - question: Which command lists the namespaces available in an NVMe-oF subsystem?
        answer: |
          Use the command: `esxcli nvme namespace list`.
      - question: How can you verify NVMe/TCP disks in the vSphere client?
        answer: |
          Navigate to the ESXi host, go to the "Storage" page under the "Devices" tab, and check if the NVMe/TCP disks
          are listed.
