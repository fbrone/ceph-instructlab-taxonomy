  - context: |
      The Ceph NVMe-oF Gateway exports RADOS Block Device (RBD) images as NVMe
      namespaces, enabling clients without

      native Ceph support to access Ceph block storage. It uses the NVMe-oF
      protocol to send NVMe commands over a

      TCP/IP network, integrating Ceph into conventional storage
      infrastructures.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Ceph NVMe-oF Gateway export?
        answer: |
          It exports RADOS Block Device (RBD) images as NVMe namespaces.
      - question: How does the NVMe-oF protocol benefit clients?
        answer: |
          It allows clients without native Ceph support to send NVMe commands
          over a TCP/IP network.
      - question: What type of infrastructure can the Ceph NVMe-oF Gateway provision?
        answer: |
          A fully integrated block-storage infrastructure, similar to a
          conventional SAN.
  - context: >
      Each Ceph NVMe-oF gateway consists of an SPDK NVMe-oF target with
      `bdev_rbd` and a control daemon. This combination

      enables efficient communication between RBD images and NVMe-oF clients for
      storage access.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the components of the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway?
        answer: |
          It includes an SPDK NVMe-oF target with `bdev_rbd` and a control
          daemon.
      - question: What does the `bdev_rbd` module do in the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway?
        answer: |
          It allows RBD images to be used as NVMe namespaces for storage access.
      - question: How does the NVMe-oF gateway facilitate storage access for clients?
        answer: |
          By enabling NVMe-oF protocol communication with RBD images.
  - context: >
      The NVMe-oF protocol allows clients to access storage over TCP/IP
      networks, making Ceph block storage accessible

      to various operating systems without requiring native Ceph client support.
      This expands Ceph's usability across

      diverse platforms.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What network protocol does the NVMe-oF gateway use for communication?
        answer: |
          It uses the NVMe-oF protocol over TCP/IP networks.
      - question: |
          How does the NVMe-oF gateway benefit operating systems without native
          Ceph support?
        answer: |
          It enables them to access Ceph block storage via the NVMe-oF protocol.
      - question: What key advantage does NVMe-oF bring to Ceph storage?
        answer: |
          It makes Ceph block storage accessible to a wider range of platforms
          and operating systems.
  - context: |
      The Ceph NVMe-oF gateway integrates with the public network and optionally
      the cluster network. It ensures seamless

      connectivity between NVMe-oF initiators and the Ceph storage cluster,
      providing reliable block storage operations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Which networks does the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway integrate with?
        answer: |
          It integrates with the public network and optionally the cluster
          network.
      - question: What role does the public network play in the NVMe-oF gateway setup?
        answer: |
          It facilitates communication between NVMe-oF initiators and the Ceph
          cluster.
      - question: Why is optional integration with the cluster network useful?
        answer: |
          It provides an additional layer of connectivity for enhanced
          performance and reliability.
  - context: |
      Configuring the Ceph NVMe-oF gateway involves setting up requirements such
      as NVMe-oF target and initiators. The

      setup ensures compatibility between the RBD module and various operating
      systems, enabling efficient storage access.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the key components required for configuring the Ceph NVMe-oF
          gateway?
        answer: |
          NVMe-oF targets, initiators, and a properly configured RBD module.
      - question: How does the gateway ensure compatibility with operating systems?
        answer: |
          Through its RBD module, which works with various operating systems.
