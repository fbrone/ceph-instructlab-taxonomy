        **HOST MANAGEMENT** deals with managing hosts in a Ceph cluster.
        Commands are available to list, add, remove, and configure hosts.
        Filtering options like host-pattern, label, and host-status can be used for customized operations.
        Cephadm uses SSH for remote connections, with options for custom keys, users, and configurations.
        Labels and tuning profiles offer fine-grained control of resource usage and placement.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What filtering options are available for listing hosts in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Filtering options include host-pattern (regex for hostname), label (specific host label), and host-status (e.g., offline, maintenance).
      - question: |
          How are hosts added to a Ceph cluster?
        answer: |
          Hosts are added by installing the cluster's SSH key on the host and running `ceph orch host add <hostname>`.
      - question: |
          What does the _admin label do in Ceph host management?
        answer: |
          The _admin label ensures the distribution of client.admin keyrings and ceph.conf files to the host.
  - context: |
        **ADDING HOSTS** involves steps to integrate a new host into a Ceph cluster.
        This includes copying the cluster's public SSH key to the host and informing Ceph of the new host.
        Labels can be applied during this process to categorize or configure the host's role.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of copying the cluster's SSH key when adding hosts?
        answer: |
          Copying the cluster's SSH key enables secure communication between Ceph and the host.
      - question: |
          How can labels be added to a new host in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Labels can be specified during host addition using the `--labels` flag, e.g., `_admin`.
      - question: |
          What happens if a host is added without specifying an IP address?
        answer: |
          Ceph resolves the hostname via DNS to determine the IP address.
  - context: |
        **REMOVING HOSTS** from a Ceph cluster requires draining all daemons before removal.
        Commands like `ceph orch host drain` help ensure no daemons or OSDs remain active.
        Special flags allow forced removal of offline hosts with potential data loss warnings.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does the `ceph orch host drain` command do?
        answer: |
          It schedules removal of all daemons and OSDs from a host, applying special labels to prevent further deployment.
      - question: |
          How are offline hosts removed from a Ceph cluster?
        answer: |
          Use `ceph orch host rm <host> --offline --force`, but it may cause data loss.
      - question: |
          What additional step is needed to remove a host from the CRUSH map?
        answer: |
          Add the `--rm-crush-entry` flag to remove the associated CRUSH bucket.
  - context: |
        **SSH CONFIGURATION** in Cephadm manages secure communication with cluster nodes.
        SSH keys are generated automatically, but custom keys or configurations can be imported.
        Different users or CA-signed keys can be set up for advanced configurations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can a custom SSH key be imported into Cephadm?
        answer: |
          Use `ceph config-key set mgr/cephadm/ssh_identity_key -i <key>` to import the private key.
      - question: |
          Can non-root users be used for Cephadm operations?
        answer: |
          Yes, but they must have passwordless sudo access and the cluster SSH key in their authorized_keys file.
      - question: |
          What command generates a new SSH key for Cephadm?
        answer: |
          Use `ceph cephadm generate-key` to generate a new SSH key.
  - context: |
        **OS TUNING PROFILES** allow Cephadm to manage sysctl settings for host performance.
        YAML specs define profiles, which are applied to hosts and stored in `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
        Profiles can be modified, viewed, or removed via Cephadm commands.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of OS tuning profiles in Ceph?
        answer: |
          OS tuning profiles manage sysctl settings to optimize host performance for Ceph operations.
      - question: |
          How are tuning profiles applied to hosts?
        answer: |
          Use `ceph orch tuned-profile apply -i <profile-file>` to apply profiles defined in YAML format.
      - question: |
          How can you view all tuning profiles managed by Cephadm?
        answer: |
          Run `ceph orch tuned-profile ls` to list all profiles.
