        The cephadm MGR service hosts multiple modules, including the Ceph Dashboard and the cephadm manager module.
        This service is critical for managing and monitoring the Ceph cluster effectively.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does the cephadm MGR service host?
        answer: |
          It hosts multiple modules, including the Ceph Dashboard and the cephadm manager module.
      - question: |
          Why is the MGR service important?
        answer: |
          The MGR service is important for managing and monitoring the Ceph cluster.
      - question: |
          Which dashboard is hosted by the MGR service?
        answer: |
            The MGR service hosts the Ceph Dashboard.
  - context: |
        The MGR service supports binding to specific IP addresses within a network. This ensures that the service can be configured for use in specified network ranges.
        For example, the following spec file binds the MGR service to a specific network:
        ```yaml
        service_type: mgr
        networks:
        - 192.169.142.0/24
        ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Can the MGR service bind to a specific network?
        answer: |
          Yes, the MGR service supports binding to specific IP addresses within a network.
      - question: |
          What is an example of binding the MGR service to a network?
        answer: |
          Example: `service_type: mgr, networks: - 192.169.142.0/24`.
      - question: |
          Why would you bind the MGR service to a specific network?
        answer: |
          To ensure the service is restricted to a specified network range.
  - context: |
        In scenarios with a single host, cephadm requires at least two MGR daemons to allow for automated upgrades of the cluster.
        This ensures redundancy and cluster stability during updates.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How many MGR daemons are required on a single host?
        answer: |
          At least two MGR daemons are required on a single host.
      - question: |
          Why are two MGR daemons required in single-host scenarios?
        answer: |
          To enable automated upgrades of the cluster.
      - question: |
          What does having multiple MGR daemons ensure during updates?
        answer: |
          It ensures redundancy and cluster stability.
  - context: |
        The cephadm MGR service allows co-location of MGR daemons with other daemons in specific scenarios.
        This approach optimizes resource utilization, especially in small-scale deployments.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does co-location of MGR daemons mean?
        answer: |
          Co-location means deploying MGR daemons alongside other daemons on the same host.
      - question: |
          When is co-location of MGR daemons useful?
        answer: |
          It is useful in small-scale deployments to optimize resource utilization.
      - question: |
          Does cephadm support co-location of MGR daemons?
        answer: |
          Yes, cephadm supports co-location of MGR daemons.
  - context: |
        The Ceph Manager Daemon supports several advanced features, including standby modules for redundancy.
        These modules ensure high availability and smooth functioning of the cluster in the event of a failure.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are standby modules in the Ceph Manager Daemon?
        answer: |
          Standby modules provide redundancy for high availability.
      - question: |
          Why are standby modules important in the MGR service?
        answer: |
          They ensure high availability and smooth functioning during failures.
      - question: |
          Where can you learn more about standby modules?
        answer: |
          Refer to the `mgr_standby_modules` section in the ceph-mgr administratorâ€™s guide.
