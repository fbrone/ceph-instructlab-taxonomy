        Podman and Ceph have different end-of-life strategies, requiring careful selection of compatible versions. Compatibility information can be summarized as follows:
        - Ceph ≤ 15.2.5 works only with Podman 1.9.
        - Ceph ≥ 15.2.6 supports Podman versions up to 2.1, but not 2.2 or higher.
        - Ceph ≥ 16.2.1 and ≥ 17.2.0 are compatible with Podman 2.0 or higher, with Podman 3.0 preferred for Quincy and later releases.
        **Note**: Podman 3.0 or greater has no known issues with Ceph Quincy and later.
        **Warning**: For Ceph Pacific, Podman 2.0.0 or higher is required, except version 2.2.1, which does not work. The "Kubic stable" version works with Ceph Pacific when using a newer kernel.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Which Podman version works with Ceph ≤ 15.2.5?
        answer: |
          Podman 1.9 works with Ceph ≤ 15.2.5.
      - question: |
          Can Podman 2.2.1 be used with Ceph Pacific?
        answer: |
          No, Podman 2.2.1 does not work with Ceph Pacific.
      - question: |
          Is Podman 3.0 compatible with Ceph Quincy?
        answer: |
          Yes, Podman 3.0 or greater is compatible with Ceph Quincy.
  - context: |
        Cephadm is a tool for managing Ceph clusters. While relatively stable, it continues to evolve, with new functionality and occasional bug fixes. Key points include:
        - Support for features like ceph-exporter deployment, stretch mode, and RGW multisite deployment is still under development.
        - Monitoring is transitioning to Prometheus with TLS integration.
        - In case of failures, the `cephadm-pause` command helps manage cluster background activity and disable cephadm.
        Issues can be reported under the Orchestrator component on the Ceph tracker.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is Cephadm used for?
        answer: |
          Cephadm is used for managing Ceph clusters.
      - question: |
          Where can issues with Cephadm be reported?
        answer: |
          Issues can be reported under the Orchestrator component on the Ceph tracker.
      - question: |
          What does the `cephadm-pause` command do?
        answer: |
          It pauses cluster background activity and disables cephadm.
  - context: |
        Stability of Cephadm is evolving as features are added, such as:
        - Deployment of the ceph-exporter.
        - Stretch mode integration.
        - Transitioning monitoring to Prometheus with TLS.
        RGW multisite deployment requires manual steps. Users should monitor the development roadmap for updates.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What new functionality is being added to Cephadm?
        answer: |
          New functionality includes ceph-exporter deployment, stretch mode integration, and Prometheus-based monitoring with TLS.
      - question: |
          Does RGW multisite deployment require manual steps?
        answer: |
          Yes, RGW multisite deployment requires many manual steps.
      - question: |
          What is Cephadm's monitoring transitioning to?
        answer: |
          Monitoring is transitioning to Prometheus with TLS integration.
  - context: |
        The compatibility of Podman and Ceph versions is critical for cluster stability. Guidelines suggest:
        - Ceph Pacific requires Podman 2.0 or higher.
        - Podman 3.0+ is highly recommended for Quincy.
        - Use "Kubic stable" for Ceph Pacific with a newer kernel.
        Testing all combinations is impractical; users should consult the compatibility matrix or documentation for guidance.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What Podman version is recommended for Ceph Quincy?
        answer: |
          Podman 3.0 or higher is recommended for Ceph Quincy.
      - question: |
          Can "Kubic stable" be used with Ceph Pacific?
        answer: |
          Yes, "Kubic stable" can be used with Ceph Pacific if a newer kernel is used.
      - question: |
          Why is a compatibility matrix needed for Podman and Ceph?
        answer: |
          A compatibility matrix is needed because not all Podman and Ceph versions are actively tested together.
  - context: |
        Compatibility between Podman and Ceph ensures smooth operations. Some key points are:
        - Cephadm continues development; expect incremental changes.
        - Podman version 3.0+ resolves compatibility for Quincy and later.
        - Troubleshooting aids like `cephadm-pause` mitigate risks during cluster failures.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the role of the `cephadm-pause` command in troubleshooting?
        answer: |
          It helps manage background activity and disable cephadm during troubleshooting.
      - question: |
          What is the recommended Podman version for Quincy?
        answer: |
          Podman version 3.0 or higher is recommended.
      - question: |
          How does Cephadm evolve?
        answer: |
          Cephadm evolves with new features, bug fixes, and enhancements to cluster management.
