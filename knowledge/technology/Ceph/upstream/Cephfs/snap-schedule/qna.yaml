      Enabling the Snapshot Scheduling Module
      ---------------------------------------

      The `snap_schedule` module allows users to create, query, and manage snapshot schedules for CephFS.
      To enable the module, run:

      ```bash
      ceph mgr module enable snap_schedule
      ```

      Key Features:
      - Schedule snapshots at specified intervals using repeat parameters (e.g., `1h`, `1d`).
      - Retention policies to control snapshot counts and timing (e.g., keep 7 daily snapshots).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you enable the snapshot scheduling module in CephFS?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph mgr module enable snap_schedule` to enable the snapshot scheduling module.
      - question: |
          What does the snapshot scheduling module provide?
        answer: |
          It provides functionality to add, query, remove snapshot schedules, and manage retention policies.
      - question: |
          What are examples of repeat intervals for snapshot schedules?
        answer: |
          Examples include `1h` (hourly), `1d` (daily), `1w` (weekly), and `1M` (monthly).

      Adding and Removing Snapshot Schedules
      --------------------------------------

      You can add snapshot schedules to a specified path using the `ceph fs snap-schedule add` command.
      To remove schedules, use the `remove` subcommand. Examples:

      ```bash
      # Add an hourly schedule
      ceph fs snap-schedule add / 1h

      # Add a daily schedule starting at 11:55
      ceph fs snap-schedule add / 1d 11:55

      # Remove a specific schedule
      ceph fs snap-schedule remove / 1h 11:55
      ```

      Notes:
      - Schedules are unique by path, repeat interval, and start time.
      - Removing all schedules for a path can be done by omitting specific intervals.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you add an hourly snapshot schedule for the root directory?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph fs snap-schedule add / 1h` to add an hourly snapshot schedule.
      - question: |
          How can you remove a specific snapshot schedule?
        answer: |
          Use the `remove` subcommand with the specific interval and start time, e.g., \
          `ceph fs snap-schedule remove / 1h 11:55`.
      - question: |
          What happens if you remove schedules for a path without specifying an interval?
        answer: |
          All schedules for the specified path will be removed.

      Retention Policies
      ------------------

      Retention policies manage how many snapshots are kept and at what intervals. Examples:

      ```bash
      # Keep 24 hourly snapshots
      ceph fs snap-schedule retention add / h 24

      # Remove a daily retention policy
      ceph fs snap-schedule retention remove / d 7

      # Add complex retention policy: 24 hourly, 4 weekly
      ceph fs snap-schedule retention add / 24h4w
      ```

      Notes:
      - Retention policies can include multiple time-period pairs.
      - Use the `retention add` and `retention remove` subcommands.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you retain 24 hourly snapshots for a specific path?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph fs snap-schedule retention add / h 24`.
      - question: |
          Can retention policies include multiple time-period pairs?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can add complex policies like `24h4w` (24 hourly, 4 weekly snapshots).
      - question: |
          How do you remove a daily retention policy for a path?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph fs snap-schedule retention remove / d 7`.

  - context: |
      Activating and Deactivating Schedules
      -------------------------------------

      Snapshot schedules can be manually activated or deactivated using the `activate` and `deactivate` commands.
      Examples:

      ```bash
      # Activate all schedules on the root directory
      ceph fs snap-schedule activate /

      # Deactivate daily snapshots on the root directory
      ceph fs snap-schedule deactivate / 1d
      ```

      Notes:
      - Inactive schedules will not trigger snapshot creation.
      - Activation restores snapshot creation for the specified schedules.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you activate all schedules for a specific path?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph fs snap-schedule activate /` to activate all schedules on the root directory.
      - question: |
          What happens to inactive schedules?
        answer: |
          Inactive schedules do not trigger snapshot creation until they are reactivated.
      - question: |
          How do you deactivate daily snapshots for a directory?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph fs snap-schedule deactivate / 1d`.

      Limitations and Data Storage
      ----------------------------

      Key limitations and data storage details:
      - Snapshot schedules use Python timers, which may delay snapshots under heavy load.
      - The maximum number of snapshots retained per directory is limited by `mds_max_snaps_per_dir` (default: 100).
      - Snapshot schedule data is stored in the CephFS metadata pool and serialized in a SQLite database.

      Example:
      ```bash
      ceph config set mds_max_snaps_per_dir 150
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the default maximum number of snapshots retained per directory?
        answer: |
          The default maximum is 100, controlled by the `mds_max_snaps_per_dir` setting.
      - question: |
          Where is snapshot schedule data stored in CephFS?
        answer: |
          Snapshot schedule data is stored in the CephFS metadata pool and serialized in a SQLite database.
      - question: |
          How can you increase the maximum number of snapshots retained per directory?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ceph config set mds_max_snaps_per_dir <new_limit>` to increase the limit.
