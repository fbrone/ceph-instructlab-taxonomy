      Overview of CephFS Snapshot Mirroring
      -------------------------------------

      CephFS supports asynchronous replication of snapshots to a remote CephFS filesystem using the \
      `cephfs-mirror` tool.
      Snapshots are mirrored by synchronizing snapshot data and creating a remote snapshot with \
      the same name as the source.

      Requirements:
      - Primary and secondary Ceph clusters must be Pacific or later versions.
      - Both clusters must support snapshot mirroring.

      Notes:
      - Ensure snapshots are enabled for both clusters.
      - `cephfs-mirror` ensures consistency by mirroring only supported file types.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does CephFS snapshot mirroring do?
        answer: |
          It replicates snapshots from a primary CephFS filesystem to a remote CephFS filesystem asynchronously.
      - question: |
          Which Ceph versions support snapshot mirroring?
        answer: |
          CephFS snapshot mirroring is supported in Pacific or later versions of Ceph clusters.
      - question: |
          How does the `cephfs-mirror` tool handle snapshot mirroring?
        answer: |
          It mirrors snapshot data and creates a remote snapshot with the same name as the source snapshot.

      Configuring Users for CephFS Mirroring
      --------------------------------------

      To use `cephfs-mirror`, users must be created on both primary and remote clusters with appropriate permissions.

      Commands:
      - On the primary cluster:
        ```
        ceph auth get-or-create client.mirror mon 'profile cephfs-mirror' mds 'allow r' \
        osd 'allow rw tag cephfs metadata=*, allow r tag cephfs data=*'
        ```
      - On the remote cluster:
        ```
        ceph fs authorize <fs_name> client.mirror_remote / rwps
        ```

      Notes:
      - Users must have write access to metadata pools on the primary cluster.
      - Users must have full MDS and OSD capabilities on the remote cluster.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What permissions are required for a user on the primary cluster for mirroring?
        answer: |
          The user must have write access to metadata pools and read access to data pools.
      - question: |
          How do you authorize a user for mirroring on the remote cluster?
        answer: |
          Use the `ceph fs authorize <fs_name> client.mirror_remote / rwps` command.
      - question: |
          Why is user creation necessary for CephFS mirroring?
        answer: |
          Users with appropriate permissions are required to perform mirroring operations on both clusters.

      Deploying and Managing Mirror Daemons
      -------------------------------------

      Mirror daemons handle the synchronization of snapshots. They can be deployed using `systemctl` or `cephadm`.

      Commands:
      - Start a mirror daemon using `systemctl`:
        ```
        systemctl enable cephfs-mirror@mirror
        systemctl start cephfs-mirror@mirror
        ```
      - Deploy daemons using `cephadm`:
        ```
        ceph orch apply cephfs-mirror
        ceph orch apply cephfs-mirror --placement="3 host1,host2,host3"
        ```

      Notes:
      - Multiple daemons can be deployed for high availability.
      - Daemons share the synchronization load using a distributed policy.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can you start a CephFS mirror daemon using `systemctl`?
        answer: |
          Use `systemctl enable cephfs-mirror@mirror` and `systemctl start cephfs-mirror@mirror`.
      - question: |
          How do you deploy multiple mirror daemons using `cephadm`?
        answer: |
          Use the `ceph orch apply cephfs-mirror --placement="<placement-spec>"` command.
      - question: |
          Why deploy multiple mirror daemons?
        answer: |
          To achieve high availability and share the synchronization load across daemons.

      Enabling and Controlling Mirroring
      ----------------------------------

      Mirroring is managed using the Mirroring module in Ceph, which assigns directories for synchronization.

      Commands:
      - Enable mirroring for a filesystem:
        ```
        ceph mgr module enable mirroring
        ceph fs snapshot mirror enable <fs_name>
        ```
      - Add a directory for mirroring:
        ```
        ceph fs snapshot mirror add <fs_name> <path>
        ```
      - Remove a directory from mirroring:
        ```
        ceph fs snapshot mirror remove <fs_name> <path>
        ```

      Notes:
      - Only absolute paths starting from the CephFS root are allowed.
      - Mirroring for ancestor or descendant directories of already mirrored paths is disallowed.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you enable mirroring for a CephFS filesystem?
        answer: |
          Run `ceph mgr module enable mirroring` followed by `ceph fs snapshot mirror enable <fs_name>`.
      - question: |
          How can you add a directory for mirroring?
        answer: |
          Use the `ceph fs snapshot mirror add <fs_name> <path>` command with an absolute directory path.
      - question: |
          Why are ancestor or descendant directories disallowed in mirroring?
        answer: |
          To prevent overlapping mirroring configurations and maintain synchronization consistency.

      Monitoring and Troubleshooting Mirroring
      ----------------------------------------

      The mirroring status and metrics can be checked using commands and admin socket interfaces.

      Commands:
      - Check mirror daemon status:
        ```
        ceph fs snapshot mirror daemon status
        ```
      - Check peer synchronization status:
        ```
        ceph --admin-daemon <socket> fs mirror peer status <fs_name>@<id> <peer_uuid>
        ```

      Notes:
      - States include `idle`, `syncing`, and `failed`.
      - Default failure and retry configurations can be adjusted via \
      `cephfs_mirror_max_consecutive_failures_per_directory`.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you check the status of a mirror daemon?
        answer: |
          Use the `ceph fs snapshot mirror daemon status` command.
      - question: |
          What are the possible states of a mirrored directory?
        answer: |
          The states are `idle` (not syncing), `syncing` (currently syncing), and `failed` (sync failures occurred).
      - question: |
          How can you monitor peer synchronization for a specific directory?
        answer: |
          Use the `ceph --admin-daemon <socket> fs mirror peer status <fs_name>@<id> <peer_uuid>` command.
