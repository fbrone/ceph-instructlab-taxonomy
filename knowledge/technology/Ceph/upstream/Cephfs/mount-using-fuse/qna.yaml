      Mounting CephFS Using FUSE
      --------------------------

      CephFS can be mounted in userspace using `ceph-fuse`. While FUSE mounts may have lower performance,
      they offer better manageability, especially during upgrades.

      Prerequisites:
      - Requires superuser privileges (sudo/root).
      - Cache entries in the kernel are trimmed using remount system calls in response to cache pressure.
      Basic command for mounting:
      - `ceph-fuse {mount point} {options}`
      Example:
      ```bash
      mkdir /mnt/mycephfs
      ceph-fuse --id foo /mnt/mycephfs
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of `ceph-fuse` in CephFS?
        answer: |
          `ceph-fuse` is used to mount CephFS in userspace, offering better manageability at the cost of performance.
      - question: |
          Why are superuser privileges required for `ceph-fuse`?
        answer: |
          Superuser privileges are needed to issue remount system calls for trimming kernel cache entries.
      - question: |
          How do you mount CephFS using a specific CephX user?
        answer: |
          Use the `--id` option with `ceph-fuse` to specify the CephX user, e.g., `ceph-fuse --id foo /mnt/mycephfs`.

      Mount Options and Specific Directories
      --------------------------------------

      - `ceph-fuse` supports additional options for mounting:
        - `-k`: Specify a custom keyring file.
        - `-m`: Pass the MON socket for explicit connection.
        - `-r`: Mount a specific directory within CephFS.
        - `--client_fs`: Mount a non-default file system.
      Example to mount a specific directory:
      ```bash
      ceph-fuse --id foo -r /path/to/dir /mnt/mycephfs
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you specify a non-default file system while mounting with `ceph-fuse`?
        answer: |
          Use the `--client_fs` option with the desired file system name, e.g., \
          `ceph-fuse --id foo --client_fs mycephfs2 /mnt/mycephfs2`.
      - question: |
          Can you mount a subdirectory of CephFS using `ceph-fuse`?
        answer: |
          Yes, use the `-r` option followed by the subdirectory path, e.g., \
          `ceph-fuse --id foo -r /path/to/dir /mnt/mycephfs`.
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the `-m` option in `ceph-fuse`?
        answer: |
          The `-m` option allows you to specify the MON socket for explicit connection during the mount.

      Persistent Mounts with FUSE
      ---------------------------

      To persistently mount CephFS, add entries to `/etc/fstab`:
      ```
      none /mnt/mycephfs fuse.ceph ceph.id={user-ID}[,ceph.conf={path/to/conf.conf}],_netdev,defaults 0 0
      ```
      For mounting subdirectories:
      ```
      none /mnt/mycephfs fuse.ceph ceph.id={user-ID},ceph.client_mountpoint=/path/to/dir,_netdev,defaults 0 0
      ```
      Systemd service units:
      - `ceph-fuse@.service` and `ceph-fuse.target` are available.
      Example commands:
      ```bash
      systemctl start ceph-fuse@/mnt/mycephfs.service
      systemctl enable ceph-fuse.target
      systemctl enable ceph-fuse@-mnt-mycephfs.service
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you make a FUSE mount of CephFS persistent across reboots?
        answer: |
          Add the relevant mount configuration to `/etc/fstab` and use systemd service units like `ceph-fuse@.service`.
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the `_netdev` option in `/etc/fstab` for CephFS?
        answer: |
          The `_netdev` option ensures the network is available before attempting to mount CephFS.
      - question: |
          How do you specify a subdirectory for persistent mounting in `/etc/fstab`?
        answer: |
          Use the `ceph.client_mountpoint` option, e.g., \
          `none /mnt/mycephfs fuse.ceph ceph.id=myuser,ceph.client_mountpoint=/path/to/dir`.

      Unmounting CephFS
      -----------------

      CephFS can be unmounted using the standard `umount` command:
      ```bash
      umount /mnt/mycephfs
      ```
      Tip:
      - Ensure you are not within the file system directories before unmounting.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you unmount a CephFS mounted via FUSE?
        answer: |
          Use the `umount` command, e.g., `umount /mnt/mycephfs`.
      - question: |
          What precaution should you take before unmounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          Ensure you are not within the file system directories to avoid errors during unmounting.
      - question: |
          Can `ceph-fuse` automatically unmount a CephFS?
        answer: |
          No, you must manually use the `umount` command to unmount a CephFS.
