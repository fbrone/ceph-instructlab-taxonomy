      Introduction to Mounting CephFS
      ------------------------------

      CephFS can be mounted using the kernel driver or the FUSE driver, each with its own advantages:
      - **Kernel Driver**: Offers better performance.
      - **FUSE Driver**: Easier to upgrade and more accessible.

      For mounting CephFS, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
      - A copy of `ceph.conf` and a CephX keyring file must be available on the client host.
      - The client host must have permissions to access the MDS.

      Example steps to set up prerequisites:
      ```bash
      # Generate a minimal ceph.conf on the client host
      mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/ceph
      ssh user@mon-host "sudo ceph config generate-minimal-conf" | sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.conf

      # Set proper permissions for ceph.conf
      chmod 644 /etc/ceph/ceph.conf

      # Create a CephX user and keyring
      ssh user@mon-host "sudo ceph fs authorize cephfs client.foo / rw" | sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.client.foo.keyring

      # Set proper permissions for the keyring
      chmod 600 /etc/ceph/ceph.client.foo.keyring
      ```
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the two ways to mount CephFS?
        answer: |
          CephFS can be mounted using the kernel driver (better performance) or the FUSE driver (easier upgrades).
      - question: |
          What files must be present on the client host before mounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          The `ceph.conf` configuration file and a CephX keyring with permissions to access the MDS.
      - question: |
          How do you generate a minimal `ceph.conf` file for the client host?
        answer: |
          Use the command `ssh user@mon-host "sudo ceph config generate-minimal-conf" | sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.conf`.

      Creating CephX User and Keyring
      -------------------------------

      A CephX user must be created for the client to access CephFS. The following steps illustrate this process:
      ```bash
      # Create a CephX user with read and write permissions
      ssh user@mon-host "sudo ceph fs authorize cephfs client.foo / rw" | sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.client.foo.keyring

      # Set proper permissions for the keyring
      chmod 600 /etc/ceph/ceph.client.foo.keyring
      ```

      Notes:
      - Replace `cephfs` with the name of your Ceph file system.
      - Use a specific path (`/`) and permission level (`rw`) for client access.
      - A single CephX username can be shared across multiple client hosts.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you create a CephX user for accessing CephFS?
        answer: |
          Use `ceph fs authorize` to create the user, e.g., \
          `ssh user@mon-host "sudo ceph fs authorize cephfs client.foo / rw"`.
      - question: |
          What permissions are required for the CephX keyring file?
        answer: |
          The keyring file should have `600` permissions, set using `chmod 600`.
      - question: |
          Can the same CephX user be used on multiple client hosts?
        answer: |
          Yes, the same CephX username can be shared across multiple client hosts.

      Kernel and FUSE Mounts: Overview
      --------------------------------

      Both kernel and FUSE mounts require the following prerequisites:
      - Superuser privileges on the client host.
      - A properly configured `ceph.conf` file.
      - A valid CephX keyring file.

      Differences between kernel and FUSE mounts:
      - Kernel mounts provide higher performance.
      - FUSE mounts are easier to upgrade and troubleshoot.

      Note:
      - Additional requirements may apply depending on the mount method used.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why are superuser privileges required for mounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          Superuser privileges are needed to set up the CephFS mount and manage the required configuration files.
      - question: |
          What is a key advantage of using the FUSE driver for mounting CephFS?
        answer: |
          The FUSE driver is easier to upgrade compared to the kernel driver.
      - question: |
          What is the main performance-related advantage of the kernel driver?
        answer: |
          The kernel driver offers better performance than the FUSE driver.

      Permissions and Security for Mounting
      -------------------------------------

      Ensuring proper file permissions is critical for secure mounting:
      - The `ceph.conf` file should have `644` permissions:
        ```bash
        chmod 644 /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
        ```
      - The CephX keyring should have `600` permissions:
        ```bash
        chmod 600 /etc/ceph/ceph.client.foo.keyring
        ```

      Always ensure these files are located in `/etc/ceph` for standardized access.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What permissions are recommended for the `ceph.conf` file?
        answer: |
          The `ceph.conf` file should have `644` permissions, set using `chmod 644`.
      - question: |
          Where should the `ceph.conf` and keyring files be located?
        answer: |
          Both files should be located in `/etc/ceph` on the client host.
      - question: |
          Why is it important to set `600` permissions on the keyring file?
        answer: |
          It prevents unauthorized access to the CephX credentials.

      Troubleshooting Client Configuration
      ------------------------------------

      Common issues during CephFS setup include:
      - **Missing configuration files**: Ensure `ceph.conf` and the CephX keyring are present in `/etc/ceph`.
      - **Permission issues**: Verify that the `ceph.conf` has `644` and the keyring has `600` permissions.
      - **Authentication errors**: Confirm that the CephX user has the necessary access rights to the MDS.

      Tips for resolving issues:
      - Run `sudo ls` before keyring-related commands to avoid repeated password prompts.
      - Check the generated `ceph.conf` for minimal configuration and correctness.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What should you do if CephFS mounting fails due to missing files?
        answer: |
          Ensure that both `ceph.conf` and the CephX keyring are located in `/etc/ceph` on the client host.
      - question: |
          How can you resolve repeated password prompts during setup commands?
        answer: |
          Run a trivial `sudo` command like `sudo ls` before issuing the setup commands.
      - question: |
          What are the recommended permissions for the keyring file to avoid authentication errors?
        answer: |
          Set the keyring file permissions to `600` using `chmod 600`.
