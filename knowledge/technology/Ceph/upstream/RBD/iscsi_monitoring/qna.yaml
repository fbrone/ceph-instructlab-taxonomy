      ## Monitoring Ceph iSCSI Gateways

      Ceph provides a tool to monitor the performance of exported RADOS Block Device (RBD) images in iSCSI gateway environments. The `gwtop` tool is similar to the `top` command, providing a real-time view of aggregated performance metrics for RBD images exported over iSCSI.

      The metrics are gathered from a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA), which sources information from the Linux-IO target (LIO) PMDA. The `gwtop` tool lists each exported RBD image, the connected clients, and their associated I/O metrics, offering a detailed view of the performance in iSCSI environments.

      ### Key Features of `gwtop`:
      - Displays aggregated performance metrics for each exported RBD image.
      - Lists the connected clients and their associated I/O performance.
      - Sourced from the Linux-IO target (LIO) PMDA, which monitors iSCSI connections.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What tool does Ceph provide for monitoring iSCSI gateway performance?
        answer: |
          Ceph provides the `gwtop` tool, which is a `top`-like utility for displaying aggregated performance metrics of RADOS Block Device (RBD) images exported to clients over iSCSI.

      - question: |
          What information is displayed by `gwtop` in Ceph iSCSI environments?
        answer: |
          `gwtop` displays information about each exported RBD image, the connected clients, and their associated I/O metrics, sourced from the Linux-IO target (LIO) PMDA.

      - question: |
          What is the source of the performance metrics displayed by `gwtop`?
        answer: |
          The performance metrics displayed by `gwtop` are sourced from a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA), which utilizes data from the Linux-IO target (LIO) PMDA to provide detailed performance information.

      ## `gwtop` Overview and Configuration

      By default, the `gwtop` tool assumes that the iSCSI gateway configuration is stored in a RADOS object named `gateway.conf` in the `rbd` pool. This configuration specifies which iSCSI gateways to contact for gathering performance statistics. This default setting can be overridden using the `-g` or `-c` flags. For further details, you can run `gwtop --help`.

      The LIO (Linux-IO) configuration plays a crucial role in determining which type of performance statistics are extracted from Performance Co-Pilot (PCP). When `gwtop` starts, it examines the LIO configuration. If user-space disks are detected, `gwtop` automatically selects the LIO collector for performance data.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Where does `gwtop` expect the iSCSI gateway configuration to be stored by default?
        answer: |
          By default, `gwtop` expects the iSCSI gateway configuration object to be stored in a RADOS object called `gateway.conf` in the `rbd` pool.

      - question: |
          How can you override the default configuration for `gwtop`?
        answer: |
          You can override the default configuration for `gwtop` by using the `-g` or `-c` flags.

      - question: |
          How does `gwtop` determine which performance statistics to extract?
        answer: |
          `gwtop` looks at the LIO configuration when it starts. If user-space disks are found, `gwtop` automatically selects the LIO collector to extract performance statistics.

      ## Example `gwtop` Outputs

      The `gwtop` tool displays aggregated performance metrics for RADOS Block Devices (RBD) exported over iSCSI. The following is an example of the `gwtop` output:

      ```
      gwtop  2/2 Gateways   CPU% MIN:  4 MAX:  5    Network Total In:    2M  Out:    3M   10:20:00
      Capacity:   8G    Disks:   8   IOPS:  503   Clients:  1   Ceph: HEALTH_OK          OSDs:   3
      Pool.Image       Src    Size     iops     rMB/s     wMB/s   Client
      iscsi.t1703             500M        0      0.00      0.00
      iscsi.testme1           500M        0      0.00      0.00
      iscsi.testme2           500M        0      0.00      0.00
      iscsi.testme3           500M        0      0.00      0.00
      iscsi.testme5           500M        0      0.00      0.00
      rbd.myhost_1      T       4G      504      1.95      0.00   rh460p(CON)
      rbd.test_2                1G        0      0.00      0.00
      rbd.testme              500M        0      0.00      0.00
      ```

      In the `Client` column, `(CON)` indicates that the iSCSI initiator (client) is currently logged into the iSCSI gateway. If `-multi-` is displayed, it means that multiple clients are mapped to the same RBD image.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does `(CON)` mean in the `Client` column of the `gwtop` output?
        answer: |
          `(CON)` indicates that the iSCSI initiator (client) is currently logged into the iSCSI gateway.

      - question: |
          What does `-multi-` indicate in the `Client` column of the `gwtop` output?
        answer: |
          `-multi-` indicates that multiple clients are mapped to a single RBD image.

      - question: |
          What kind of performance metrics does `gwtop` display?
        answer: |
          `gwtop` displays performance metrics such as CPU usage, network in/out, disk capacity, IOPS, read and write MB/s, and the status of clients connected to the iSCSI gateway.
