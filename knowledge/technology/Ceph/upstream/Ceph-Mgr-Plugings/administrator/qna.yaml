      Manual Setup
      To set up a ceph-mgr daemon manually, create an authentication key using:
      ceph auth get-or-create mgr.$name mon 'allow profile mgr' osd 'allow *' mds 'allow *'
      Place the keyring file in the mgr data path, such as /var/lib/ceph/mgr/ceph-$name/keyring.
      Start the ceph-mgr daemon with:
      ceph-mgr -i $name
      Verify the daemon status using:
      ceph status
      Check for a mgr active status line.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you create an authentication key for ceph-mgr?
        answer: |
          Use the command: ceph auth get-or-create mgr.$name mon 'allow profile mgr' osd 'allow *' mds 'allow *'.
      - question: |
          Where should the keyring file be placed?
        answer: |
          Place it in /var/lib/ceph/mgr/ceph-$name/keyring.
      - question: |
          How can you verify the ceph-mgr daemon status?
        answer: |
          Use the command: ceph status and check for a mgr active status line.

      Client Authentication
      The ceph-mgr daemon needs CephX capabilities. In older clusters or custom setups, grant permissions by adding
      "mgr allow *" to the client's CephX capabilities to avoid EACCES errors.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why might you encounter EACCES errors with ceph-mgr?
        answer: |
          You might lack proper CephX capabilities for the client.
      - question: |
          How do you fix authentication errors for ceph-mgr?
        answer: |
          Add "mgr allow *" to the client's CephX capabilities.
      - question: |
          When is adding CephX capabilities necessary?
        answer: |
          When using custom tools or upgrading from an old Ceph version.

      High Availability
      Deploy ceph-mgr on hosts running ceph-mon for better availability. Monitors activate the first ceph-mgr that starts.
      Others remain on standby. If the active daemon fails, it is replaced by a standby after a grace period.
      Use ceph mgr fail  to manually mark a daemon as failed.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why should ceph-mgr be deployed on hosts running ceph-mon?
        answer: |
          To ensure high availability with automatic failover.
      - question: |
          What happens if the active ceph-mgr fails?
        answer: |
          It is replaced by a standby after the configured grace period.
      - question: |
          How can you manually mark a ceph-mgr daemon as failed?
        answer: |
          Use the command: ceph mgr fail .

      Performance and Scalability
      Enable caching using:
      ceph config set mgr mgr_ttl_cache_expire_seconds
      Set TTL to 10 seconds for clusters with 500+ OSDs or 10k+ PGs to reduce latency.
      Use:
      ceph daemon mgr.$MGRNAME perf dump
      to retrieve performance metrics, including cache hit/miss ratios.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you enable caching in ceph-mgr?
        answer: |
          Use: ceph config set mgr mgr_ttl_cache_expire_seconds.
      - question: |
          When is enabling caching recommended?
        answer: |
          When there are 500+ OSDs or 10k+ PGs in the cluster.
      - question: |
          How can you check the cache hit/miss ratio in ceph-mgr?
        answer: |
          Use: ceph daemon mgr.$MGRNAME perf dump.

      Using Modules
      List available and enabled modules with:
      ceph mgr module ls
      Enable a module using:
      ceph mgr module enable
      Disable a module using:
      ceph mgr module disable
      Use:
      ceph mgr services
      to view module addresses.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you list available and enabled modules in ceph-mgr?
        answer: |
          Use the command: ceph mgr module ls.
      - question: |
          How can you view the addresses of enabled modules?
        answer: |
          Use the command: ceph mgr services.
      - question: |
          How can you enable a module in ceph-mgr?
        answer: |
          Use the command: ceph mgr module enable .
